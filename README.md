# Ethiopia Earthquake Monitor 🌍

A sophisticated real-time earthquake monitoring and analysis platform specifically designed for Ethiopia. This application leverages advanced technologies to provide comprehensive seismic activity tracking, risk assessment, and educational resources for earthquake preparedness.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Real-time Monitoring & Analysis
- **Live Data Integration**: Direct connection with USGS API for real-time earthquake data
- **Interactive Mapping**: Dynamic visualization using Leaflet with custom markers and risk zones
- **Risk Heatmap**: Regional risk assessment with detailed geological information
- **Advanced Prediction Model**: Sophisticated seismic activity prediction using:
  - Temporal clustering analysis
  - Magnitude trend evaluation
  - Frequency pattern recognition
  - Risk probability calculations

### Trends, Search & Personalized Alerts
- **Historical Trends Dashboard**: Year-long magnitude trend chart, monthly frequency breakdown, and most active regions
- **Advanced Search**: Filter earthquakes by date range, magnitude range, and place, with CSV export
- **Watched Regions**: Save specific places with a custom radius and magnitude threshold, and get a personalized alert feed plus browser notifications when matching earthquakes occur
